			<h3>Current Project</h3>
			<p>Recently, two friends and I began developing a mobile app. We are creating a period tracker so women can track data relevant to their periods and get predictions on when their next period will occur. We identified a market for this app because most of the period tracker apps have limited functionality and a poor user experience. I am currently teaching myself Swift as well as mobile development techniques and best practices to complete the iOS version of our app.</p>
			<h3>Dr. Coffee</h3>
			<p>As part of Yelp's internal hackathon, another intern and I augmented a Mr. Coffee to be controlled over wifi. We attached a <a href="https://store.particle.io/collections/photon">photon</a> to the coffee maker so we could turn the coffee maker on and off over the cloud. We also added sensors to track the temperature of the coffee and the amount remaining in the pot. A web app allowed users to view this data, start and stop the brew process, and see the brew time remaining from anywhere in the office. Checkout Dr. Coffee's <a href="https://github.com/eldon/CoffeeCoffeeCoffee">Github</a>.</p>
			<h3>Processing</h3>
			<p>Processing is a programming language based off of Java and built for visual design and electronic arts. I found out about Processing and started playing with it in the summer of 2014. Since then I have created a few starter projects which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/leahdineen/processing" target="_blank">Github</a>. Although Processing is designed to help graphic designers learn to code, as a programmer I found it has helped me learn more about graphic design.</p>
			<p>The background of this website was one of my first projects in Processing. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/leahdineen/processing/tree/circle_background" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				Leah is extremely well organized and detail oriented in her approach to tasks. 
				She masters projects quickly due to her keen intellect and carries them out in 
				a precise and error free manner. We often were surprised that Leah had already 
				finished a complex task and marveled about how she had done it with such 
				thoroughness and efficiency.
