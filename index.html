			I'm Leah Dineen, a third year Honours Computer Science 
			Co-op student at the University of Waterloo with minors in Philosophy, Cognitive Science, and plans to minor in Combinatorics & Optimization. Through past employment
			and co-op terms, I have gained experience in quality assurance, web design and development.
			My goal is to continue combining my academic and work background with excellent
			analytical and problem-solving skills to gain experience in software development, artificial intelligence, and other areas of computer science.
			<br/><br/>
			I invite you to browse my website and look forward to 
			meeting with you to discuss how my skill set and personality can fit with your organization.

					I am currently in my third year of Honours Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. 
					I decided to study computer science after attending a GoEng Girls engineering seminar in grade 8. 
					Since then, I have attended many computer science related seminars and programs and have spoken 
					with professionals to learn more about computer science and related fields of study.
					I am fascinated by the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics and I am 
					excited to learn more through university courses and co-op jobs.
					<br/><br/>
					Computer science interests me because of its logical nature as well as the challenge 
					and sense of achievement that comes from advanced problem solving. 
					In my spare time, I love solving brain-teasers and puzzles like Planarity and Flow.

					Participation in the Shad program at Carleton University in 2011 has been my most 
					rewarding experience to date. Shad brings together the best and brightest 
					high school students from across Canada to develop entrepreneurial, leadership, and 
					teamwork skills. Shad Carleton was a life-changing experience. I had the opportunity 
					to interact with highly gifted peers. We challenged each other, both intellectually and 
					creatively, on an ongoing basis. Our main project was to develop a product to improve the 
					lives of Canadian children with disabilities. Through teamwork and consensus building, 
					my group developed an iPad app to help children with autism communicate. After completing 
					market research, we developed a prototype and a business plan which we then presented to 
					a panel of judges.

					Since the age of 6, I have been an active participant in basketball; in my opinion the 
					best team sport. I began playing in a local house league and continued to play in the 
					league for 8 years. Throughout high school, I coached a team of 6 and 7 year olds. It was 
					rewarding to teach children fundamental skills and fair play as well as share my love of 
					basketball; just as my coaches had done for me.
					<br /><br />I played for my school teams in elementary and high school. Both of the years 
					I played on the varsity team, our team went undefeated in league play and medaled in 
					the regional tournament.
					<br /><br />I no longer play competitive basketball, but continue to play 
					in the UW intramural league. I also get my basketball fix by watching my favourite team, the Duke 
					University Blue Devils.

			<h3>This Website</h3>
			<p>I created this website to improve my front-end development skills as well to give potential employers a way to learn more about me.</p>
			<p>To see all of the side projects I have worked on, check out my <a href="https://github.com/leahdineen" target="_blank">Github</a>. </p>
			<h3>Processing</h3>
			<p>Processing is a programming language based off of Java and built for visual design and electronic arts. I found out about Processing and started playing with it in the summer of 2014. Since then I have created a few starter projects which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/leahdineen/processing" target="_blank">Github</a>. Although Processing is designed to help graphic designers learn to code, as a programmer I found it has helped me learn more about graphic design.</p>
			<p>The background of this website was one of my first projects in Processing. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/leahdineen/processing/tree/circle_background" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<h3>Town of Ingersoll</h3>
			<p>During high school, I completed a successful co-op placement with the Town of Ingersoll's IT Department. I was responsible for creating a website for the Economic Development Department. Shortly after my co-op term ended, the IT Department received funding to hire me to update the Town of Ingersoll website. Both websites were created using the DotNetNuke Content Management System. I was responsible for aesthetics, adding content, and finishing details for the websites. My knowledge of graphic art was combined with critical analysis of other municipal websites to create user-friendly, appealing websites.</p>
			<p>Both the Economic Development and the Town of Ingersoll websites have since been updated and my designs are no longer used.</p>

				Leah is extremely well organized and detail oriented in her approach to tasks. 
				She masters projects quickly due to her keen intellect and carries them out in 
				a precise and error free manner. We often were surprised that Leah had already 
				finished a complex task and marveled about how she had done it with such 
				thoroughness and efficiency.
